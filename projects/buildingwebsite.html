                    To make a website the first thing I did was to decide which tools to use to get the job done. I knew I wanted to use mostly HTML and CSS but didn't know which platform to use to deploy the website. After looking into various solutions such as Node.JS,
                    Google Sites, Wordpress and Firebase, I decided on Firebase static hosting as it would allow me to Deploy a HTML and CSS webapp with relative ease and minimal setup. In addition to firebase, I decided to use bootstrap which simplifies
                    a lot of the tedium of website generation.<br> Next I made of mockup image of what the website should look like, below is what I decided on for the home page and the blog page. You can see that a few changes has
                    been made to the home page since this iteration.

                <p>From there, I got started on understanding the fundementals of firebase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kRgVxULbag">following this tutorial</a>
