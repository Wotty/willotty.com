                    I wanted to create a flask web app so I could record my workouts there was a few requirements I wanted to satisfy: Be able to create workouts with sets and exercises, save data to an online database, Host it to <a href="http://workout.willotty.com">workout.willotty.com</a>
                    <br> I had no prior knowledge of flask, hosting dynamic web apps or online database management so there was a huge knowledge gap. Step one was understanding what tools I would need to use to get the job done. I settled on using Flask
                    and python (obviously) as well as firebase for the database side of things. I had used firebase hosting before to launch a static website (The very website you are reading at the moment).<br>The first part of the project was to attempt
                    a hello 👋 world 🌎 with flask and host it locally. Luckily, 🍀 this was quite easy as flask allows for quick configuration to host locally. The next step was to play ▶️ around with different (preferrably free) services that allow
                    me to deploy webapps to the cloud ☁️ and different BaaS (Backend as a service) options. I settled on cloud run and firebase real-time database as they are both gcloud offerings with very generous free tiers. Little did I know at the
                    time ⏰️ this would not match my requirements. As although it satisfies requirements 1 and 2. It is impossible to host to a custom domain for free 💰. Instead I opted to host the middle layer on Heroku and use firebase real-time database
                    as the project's BaaS.
