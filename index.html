                <br><br> Will is a graduate of the University of Warwick with a degree in Engineering Business Management. He has experience in the finance and technology sector, having worked as an auditor at PwC and a data analyst at Vodafone. During
                University, he learned to code using MATLAB, C, Java and Python. While auditing digital technologies at large financial institutions, Will's attention to detail was critical to him carrying out his daily tasks. At all times, he had to
                maintain high-quality work often to very tight deadlines. In addition, Will managed his time alongside studying towards the ACA qualification, having passed 3 exams while at the firm. As part of an extracurricular student project, Will
                managed the finances for a team of 40 students. He organised a group of 10 people to create and lead engaging pitches for investors. It was essential for Will to organise colleagues, collate ideas and resources effectively to ensure investment
                was secured. His team generated over Â£50,000 in investment. Will would like to work within the technology industry where he can apply his skills.
